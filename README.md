# SpellCheck
SpellCheck is a class that hopes to provide spellcheck and 
word correction in sentences.

SpellCheck goes to a string, finds errors and attempts to predict the writers
original intention.

SpellCheck employs a minified set of english words (94021 in precise 
which can easily be extended) in attempting to correct users error based 
on the principle of least possible error (It assumes the error is not too great).
SpellCheck can be used to create a Google-like "Did you mean" features in your
websites and much more.
